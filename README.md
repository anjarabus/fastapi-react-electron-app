# FastAPI-React Desktop App with ElectronJS 

In this project, I use electronJS to build a desktop app which has a simple React front-end and Python (FastAPI) back-end. 

## Steps to build the app on your computer: 
(MacOS only: for windows you will need to make some changes to your configuration first)

1. Build the React front-end:<br/> 
   `cd frontend/`<br/> 
   `npm run build`
3. Use PyInstaller to compile Python back-end into a standalone executable:<br/>
   `cd ..`(back to root directory) <br/>
   `npm run py-build`
5.
